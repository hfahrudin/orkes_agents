# Orkes Agents

**Note:** This project is currently under constructions.

## Overview

Orkes Agents is a collection of agentic tools powered by [Orkes](https://github.com/hfahrudin/orkes) as the backend, providing a one-stop solution for handling complex tasks with ease.

## Core Concepts

*   **Agents**: These are specialized components designed for specific tasks. For example, an agent might be responsible for web searching, data processing, or decision-making.
*   **Grounded Interaction**: Agents can interact with user-provided files and resources, while remaining sandboxed to prevent unintended access or context leakage.
*   **Orkes Integration**: Orkes serves as the orchestration engine, managing the execution, state, and communication between agents in a scalable and observable manner.

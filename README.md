# Orkes Agents

**Note:** This project is currently under constructions.

## Overview

Orkes Agents is a collection of agentic tools powered by [Orkes](https://github.com/hfahrudin/orkes) as the backend, providing a one-stop solution for handling complex tasks with ease.

## Core Concepts

*   **Agents**: These are specialized components designed for specific tasks. For example, an agent might be responsible for web searching, data processing, or decision-making.
*   **Grounded Interaction**: Agents can interact with user-provided files and resources, while remaining sandboxed to prevent unintended access or context leakage.
*   **Orkes Integration**: Orkes serves as the orchestration engine, managing the execution, state, and communication between agents in a scalable and observable manner.

## Incoming Agent Release

We are preparing to release a new set of agents designed to further enhance the capabilities of the Orkes Agents platform. These agents will focus on:
*   **Academic Research**: Agents capable of sifting through academic papers, summarizing findings, and extracting key information to aid researchers.
*   **Food Recommendation**: Agents that can provide personalized food and recipe recommendations based on dietary preferences, available ingredients, and culinary goals.
*   **Movie Recommendation**: Agents designed to suggest movies and TV shows tailored to individual tastes, taking into account viewing history, genres, and moods.

These new agents aim to provide more specialized and efficient solutions for common information retrieval and recommendation tasks, leveraging the power of Orkes for robust orchestration.
